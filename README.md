# 🧠 C From Scratch — My Systems Programming Playground

Welcome. This repo is my personal journey to master the C programming language — from raw syntax to real-world systems-level projects. It’s not a course, it’s not a tutorial site — it’s just me, building stuff, solving problems, and learning by doing.

If you stumbled here from my resume or GitHub, here’s what this is all about.

## 🧭 Why This Exists

After years of working higher up the stack — web, frontend, APIs — I decided to go deeper.

This repo documents my hands-on exploration of:

- 💾 How memory *really* works
- 🧵 How threads and processes coordinate
- ⚙️ How parsers, allocators, and shells tick
- 📚 Classic data structures — rebuilt from scratch
- 🌐 Sockets, protocols, and low-level networking

I’m using **pure C** (no frameworks, no sugarcoating) and working on bite-sized but challenging projects. It’s half DSA training, half systems playground.

## 🔧 What's Inside

### 🧱 Core Topics

- Pointers, arrays, and memory management
- Manual memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`, custom allocators)
- File I/O, system calls, and working with the OS
- TCP/UDP socket programming
- Concurrency using pthreads
- Debugging, profiling, and optimizing C code

### 🛠️ Real-World Projects

> All built in 100% C (unless bridged via Node.js or Bash for wrappers)

- Markdown to HTML Converter  
- CSV to JSON CLI Tool  
- Port Scanner & Ping Utility  
- Stopwatch, Pomodoro Timer (TUI/CLI)  
- Memory Allocator Simulator  
- Naive Bayes Text Classifier  
- TOTP Authenticator  
- JSON Pretty Printer  
- Local Peer Discovery via UDP

## 🧠 What I’m Working Toward

- Becoming dangerous with C and systems programming
- Building muscle memory with data structures & algorithms in C
- Writing tools that don’t just work — they *teach me something*
- Laying the foundation for backend/devtools/infra roles
