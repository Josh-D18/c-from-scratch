# 🔧 N-Day C Project Sprint

A 40-day solo sprint building real-world C tools — from Markdown converters and math engines to low-level memory allocators and ICMP networking. No frameworks. No hand-holding. Just raw C and problem-solving.

Each project was built in under a day, with stretch goals for deeper challenges. All code is 100% C unless otherwise noted (Node.js used only for wrappers or bridges).

## 🛠️ Why This Sprint?

To master:

- C memory handling and pointer logic
- File I/O and system calls
- Building parsers and interpreters
- Working with sockets and protocols
- Creating CLI-first tools people actually use

---

## 🔄 Future Plans
